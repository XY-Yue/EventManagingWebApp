# EventManagingWebsiteSpring

Another learning project for myself based on [EventManagingSystem](https://github.com/XY-Yue/EventManagingSystem). The learning goal for this project is Java's [Spring
framework](https://spring.io/), [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) and basics of how a web app works. For a detailed explaination on the features and structure of the project, see [EventManagingSystem](https://github.com/XY-Yue/EventManagingSystem). For more details on the UI, see [EventManagingWebsite](https://github.com/XY-Yue/EventManagingWebsite).  
Currently, only the room related features are complete.
